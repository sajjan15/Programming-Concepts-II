Human Resources Management System
This project implements a model of a Human Resources Management System for a tiny college. It includes functionality to manage departments, teachers (both part-time and full-time), staff, and payroll computation. The system incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, graphical user interface (GUI) design, file handling, and testing.

Testing
Unit tests have been provided to ensure the functionality of all methods. To run the tests, execute the test suite using JUnit.

Project Structure
The project is structured into three main parts:

Analysis and Design Document: Contains pseudocode and UML Class Diagrams
Project Code: Implementation of all required features written in Java.
Test Suite: Unit tests to verify the functionality of methods.

Implementation Details
